# check-versions.sh — version-sync guard for the 10-surface tracking contract.
#
# CONTRIBUTING.md §6 requires the bundle version and every skill version to
# stay in sync across the typed system catalog, VERSIONS.md, plugin.json, both
# marketplace mirrors, root/localized README badges, AGENTS.md, and CLAUDE.md. Keeping
# these release surfaces aligned by
# hand is exactly the kind of mechanical step that drifts, so CI enforces it:
#
#   1. Bundle version (plugin.json) == every "version" field in both
#      marketplace.json mirrors == README + zh badge == "current bundle"
#      lines == CLAUDE.md declaration == VERSIONS.md "Current release" line,
#      and the changelog has a `### v<bundle>` entry.
#   2. Every SKILL.md: top-level `version` == `metadata.version` == its row
#      in the VERSIONS.md table (per-skill last-changed versioning means
#      rows may differ from the bundle — they must only match their skill).
#   3. VERSIONS.md has exactly one row per skill directory, none extra.
#   4. The GitHub About SSOT (.github/repo-about.json) leads with the current
#      skill count — the About is not a versioned file, so it silently drifted
#      on the v13/v14 discipline bumps; this keeps its count honest offline, and
#      scripts/sync-about.sh + about-drift.yml handle projecting/verifying it on GitHub.
#
# Bash plus Python stdlib JSON parsing (repo dependency policy). Exit 0 clean, 1 on any
# mismatch, with one FAIL line per finding.
