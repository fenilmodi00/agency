"""Structural lint for the eval seed set — Python 3 stdlib only.

This is NOT an eval *runner*: it never calls a model and never executes a skill.
It only guards the *structure* of the manually-authored `evals/<skill>/cases.md`
corpus so capability-expansion edits cannot silently rot it. Two guards:

  1. Presence + parseability: every skill (a subdir of a phase dir) has a
     `cases.md`; every case object carries the required keys; every
     `target_skill` names a real skill slug.
  2. No-dropped-skill regression: the committed `evals/structure-manifest.json`
     records the structural facts (skill list, count, required keys). A skill
     that had a cases.md and lost it fails the run.

The manifest stores ONLY structural facts (never output scores) — a key
allowlist is enforced so it can never quietly grow into the rejected
"output-score baseline" runner.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/check-evals.py            # lint + compare to manifest (CI gate; exit 1 on fail)
  python3 scripts/check-evals.py --update    # regenerate the manifest after an intentional change
